# Hanami::Mentorship
Mentorship is a relationship in which a more experienced or more knowledgeable person helps to guide a less experienced or less knowledgeable person. The mentor may be older or younger, but have a certain area of expertise.

A mentor and mentee on HM setup are volunteers. HM is a resource for aiding the process of mentoring. It is born of the pure joy of helping others and finding joy in doing so. It relies on a giving back to the spirit that giveth forth. The joy is in the journey. It is inspired by the spirit in which the Lotus Ruby Framework was built, it bears a great spiritual hunger. I hope you will be nourished herewithin.
